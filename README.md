Breakout Clone
Overview
Break Out Neo is a 2D Breakout-inspired game that challenges players to destroy bricks, collect power-ups, and keep their ball in play while managing limited lives. The player controls a paddle to bounce the ball and strategically clear all bricks in the level, aiming for the highest score possible.

Objective
The goal of the game is to destroy all bricks on the screen while managing your ball and lives effectively. Use power-ups to enhance your gameplay and avoid losing all lives before completing the level. Once all bricks are destroyed, you'll advance to a random level layout. Keep playing to achieve your highest score!

How to Play

Launch Ball: The ball automatically launches at the start of the game or after respawning.

Power-Ups
Three unique power-ups can appear while destroying bricks, each providing strategic advantages:

Time Slow: Temporarily slows down the ball and gameplay, allowing for precise paddle control and more time to plan your moves.

Extra Life: Gain an additional life, up to a maximum of 5 lives, allowing you to recover from mistakes.
